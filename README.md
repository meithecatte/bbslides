This repository contains the slides for the [talk we gave](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/226546), "Formal verification of the 5th Busy Beaver value".

A recording is [available on YouTube][recording].

These slides were prepared using [slipshow].

Due to time constraints during the preparation of the talk, this repository contains only some of the slides, as for some parts, we used pre-existing slides made with Google Docs.
